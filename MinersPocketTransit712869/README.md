## Miners Pocket Transit US712869

# Description
A expired patent by J. H. Trerise from 1902 is the inspiration for this gadget. 

During our research, sadly we did not find any mention anywhere on the internet or in books that this gadget was ever made or sold. It may have just been made by the inventor J. H. Trerise and may have not been widely manufactured. 

While building the 3D files there were certain impractical things about this transit compared to the more standard and earlier Brunton Pocket Transit. We have changed certain elements of the design to correct problems we saw with the device and have also made changes to fit it for the medium 3D printing.

Throughout the design we tried to use brass parts for the metallic ones to make sure that they did not interfere with the magnetic compass needle.
