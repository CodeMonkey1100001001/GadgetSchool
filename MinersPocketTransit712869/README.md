## Miners Pocket Transit US712869

# Description
A expired patent from 1902 is the inspiration for this gadget. 

During our research, sadly we did not find any mention anywhere on the internet or in books that this was ever made or sold. It may have just been made by the inventor J. H. Trerise. There are certain impractical things about it compared to the earlier Brunton Pocket Transit. 

We have changed certain elements of the design to correct problems we saw with the device and have also made changes to fit it for the medium FDS 3D printing.

Throughout the design we tried to use brass parts for the metallic ones to make sure that they did not interfere with the magnetic compass needle.
